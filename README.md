Test of idea of one way to convert Tiled outputs for use in Gamesmaster on the Sam Coupe


See the Explanation.docx file for an overview of the code

The Tiled files and python script are included.
Also included is a .mgt disk image that can be used in Sim Coupe.
This disk image also contains my customised version of the Gamesmaster Editor, and the Basic and Gamnesmate standalone file to run the example by itself without the editor.

Very much a work in progress!
